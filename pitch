I really like the publication The Verge. They cover technology, science, entertainment, design and world news. They cover those beats in
a weird, cool angle. The design of their website is done really well. Slate also does the same in their content.

I want our publication to do the same as The Verge and Slate where there are different sections for beats and of course it would apply to
New York City. It seems like The Verge and Slate aims to a younger audience. I feel we should focus on the same as well.

I want to allow this to be highly customable. But some pieces would be great are local election coverage, technology in the city and food
deserts in the city.
